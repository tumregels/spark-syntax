I find these talks very insightful into writing \"real big data\" applications. These talks also cover a broader subject matter like how to manage a large spark cluster, etc.\nExample: Apache Spark - Spark + AI Summit San Francisco 2018\nSpark Books\nThe O'reilly books on Spark is how I got into Spark. They are either written by some highly profiled people in the Spark community (Holden Karau) or the original members that created Spark back in the AmpLabs days (Matei Zaharia).\nThe two that I would recommend are:\n\nLearning Spark: Lightning-Fast Big Data Analysis\n\nBack in the early days of Spark, this was the only book out there. I started off with this book. It gives a nice overview of everything in Spark.  \nIt might be a bit outdated but none-the-less it will give you an appreciation for how far Spark has come.\nThis is written by Holden Karau and Matei Zahario most noticably.\n\n\nSpark: The Definitive Guide: Big Data Processing Made Simple\n\nThis book is more up-to-date as it talks more in-depth about Spark SQL and the DataFrames API.  \nThis book is written by Matei Zahario most noticably.\n\n\n\nSpark Release Docs\nSpark is an open-source project under Apache, and releases new features regularly.

As mentioned before, we will focus on the DataFrame datatype. \n\nThis is most performant and commonly used datatype. \nRDDs are a thing of the past and you should refrain from using them unless you can't do the transformation in DataFrames.\nDatasets are a thing in Spark scala.\n\nIf you have used a DataFrame in Pandas, this is the same thing. If you haven't, a dataframe is similar to a csv or excel file. There are columns and rows that you can perform transformations on. You can search online for better descriptions of what a DataFrame is.\nWhat Happened?\nFor any DataFrame (df) that you work with in Spark you should provide it with 2 things:\n\na schema for the data. Providing a schema explicitly makes it clearer to the reader and sometimes even more performant, if we can know that a column is nullable. This means providing 3 things:\nthe name of the column\nthe datatype of the column\nthe nullability of the column\n\n\nthe data. Normally you would read data stored in gcs, aws etc and store it in a df, but there will be the off-times that you will need to create one. \n\n"},"Chapter 1 - Basics/Section 3 - Reading your First Dataset.html":{"url":"Chapter 1 - Basics/Section 3 - Reading your First Dataset.html","title":"Section 3 - Reading your First Dataset","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nThe above also shows you the \"best practices\" for importing these components into your program.\n*some of the above imports will be explained later, just know this is how you should import these functions into your Spark application.\nThese are the essential imports that you will need for any PySpark program. \nSparkSessionThe SparkSession is how you begin a Spark application.

You should be able to perform anything with DataFrames now, if not you will have to work with RDDs, which I will not cover.\nSpark gives you the option to automatically infer the schema and types of columns in your dataset. But you should always specify a schema for the data that you're reading in. For each column in the csv file we specified:\n\nthe name of the column\nthe data type of the column\nif null values can appear in the column\n\nConclusion\nCongratulations! You've read in your first dataset in Spark. Next we'll look at how you can perform transformations on this dataset :).\n"},"Chapter 1 - Basics/Section 4 - More Comfortable with SQL.html":{"url":"Chapter 1 - Basics/Section 4 - More Comfortable with SQL.html","title":"Section 4 - More Comfortable with SQL","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 4 - More Comfortable with SQL?\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\ndf = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\ndf.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      species_id\n      name\n      birthday\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegister DataFrame as a SQL Table\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"pets\")\n\nWhat Happened?\nThe first step in making a df queryable with SQL is to register the table as a sql table.\nThis particular function will replace any previously registered local table named pets as a result. There are other functions that will register a dataframe with slightly different behavior.

It takes a sql string as an input and outputs a new df.\nConclusion?\nIf you're more comfortable with writing sql than python/spark code, then you can do so with a spark df! We do this by:\n\nRegister the df with df.createOrReplaceTempView('table').\nCall the sql function on your spark session with a sql string as an input.\nYou're done!\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 1.1 - Struct Types.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 1.1 - Struct Types.html","title":"Section 1.1 - Struct Types","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 1.1 - Struct Types\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.show()\n\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\n| id|breed_id|nickname|           birthday|age|color|weight|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\n|  1|       1|    King|2014-11-22 12:30:31|  5|brown|  10.0|\n|  2|       3|   Argus|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 10| null|   5.5|\n|  3|       1|  Chewie|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 15| null|    12|\n|  3|       2|   Maple|2018-11-22 10:05:10| 17|white|   3.4|\n|  4|       2|    null|2019-01-01 10:05:10| 13| null|    10|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\nStruct Types\nWhat are they used for?

We will go through some ways to get around these as they are hard to debug.\nHere is some simple jargon that we will use in the following examples:\n\nInteger: The set of numbers including all the whole numbers and their opposites (the positive whole numbers, the negative whole numbers, and zero). ie. -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.\nIrrational Number: The set including all numbers that are non- terminating, non- repeating decimals. ie. 2.1, 10.5, etc.\nPrecision: the maximum total number of digits.\nScale: the number of digits on the right of dot.\n\nSource:\n\nlink\nlink\n\nCase 1: Working With Decimals in Python\nprint(\"Example 1 - {}\".format(Decimal(20)))\nprint(\"Example 2 - {}\".format(Decimal(\"20.2\")))\nprint(\"Example 3 - {}\".format(Decimal(20.5)))\nprint(\"Example 4 - {}\".format(Decimal(20.2)))\n\nExample 1 - 20\nExample 2 - 20.2\nExample 3 - 20.5\nExample 4 - 20.199999999999999289457264239899814128875732421875\nWhat Happened?\nLet's break down the examples above.\nExample 1:\nHere we provided a whole number, so nothing special.\nExample 2:\nHere we provided a string representing an irrational number. The precision and scale were preserved.\nExample 3:\nHere we provided an irrational number. The precision and scale were preserved.\nExample 4:\nHere we provided an irrational number, but this isn't what we expected? Well this is because it's impossible to provide an exact representation of 20.2 on the computer! If you want to know more about this you can look up \"IEEE floating point representation\". We will keep this in mind for later on.\nIEEE Floating Point Represenatation (OUT OF SCOPE OF HANDBOOK)\nWhen you were little have you ever tried to divide 10 by 3, did the result ever terminate? No. You were left with 3.33333... This is a similar case with trying to represent some irrational numbers on a computer.\n\n\"There's only 10 types of people in the world: those who get binary and those who don't.\"\n\nLet's think about how a computer works, if we go down to the lowest level, everything is stored as a binary value either a 0 or 1. Every whole number is easily representable, 11 is 3, 101 is 5, etc. But when it comes to irrational numbers there has been extensive work and established standards to representing these numbers most correctly. One of these standards are called the IEEE-754 32-bit Single-Precision Floating-Point Numbers.\nIEEE-754 32-bit Single-Precision Floating-Point Numbers\n\nFrom the picture above we can see that to represent a single irrational or floating point number, you only have 32 bits (or 64 in other cases) and a set number of bits for each portion of the number. Only 1 bit is ever needed for the signed bit, then the number of bits will vary for the whole (exponent) number and then decimal fractional) values.\nI won't show you how the whole number and floating point values are computed, you can refer to other references for this. For example, this is a very good example: link.\nLet's look at our examples above:\n\n\n\nexample\nsigned\nexponent\nfraction\n\n\n\n\n20.2\n0\n010000011\n01000011001100110011010\n\n\n20.5\n0\n010000011\n01001000000000000000000\n\n\n\nIf you did the calculations for 20.2 you will notice that the fraction portion never actually divides nicely. Like I mentioned with the simply example above with trying to divide 10 by 3 nicely, it's impoosible you will always have some leftover/remainder values. But with 20.5 we can see that it divides nicely.\nCase 2: Reading in Decimals in Spark (Incorrectly)\npets = read_csv(\n    fname=path,\n    schema=[\n        (\"id\", T.LongType(), False),\n        (\"breed_id\", T.LongType(), True),\n        (\"nickname\", T.StringType(), True),\n        (\"birthday\", T.TimestampType(), True),\n        (\"age\", T.LongType(), True),\n        (\"color\", T.StringType(), True),\n        (\"weight\", T.DecimalType(), True),\n    ]\n)\npets.show()\n\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\n| id|breed_id|nickname|           birthday|age|color|weight|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\n|  1|       1|    King|2014-11-22 12:30:31|  5|brown|    10|\n|  2|       3|   Argus|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 10| null|     6|\n|  3|       1|  Chewie|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 15| null|    12|\n|  3|       2|   Maple|2018-11-22 10:05:10| 17|white|     3|\n|  4|       2|    null|2019-01-01 10:05:10| 13| null|    10|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+------+\nWhat Happened?\nWhat happened to our scalar values, they weren't read in?

To look at your data you must perform a take operation to trigger your transformations to be evaluated. There are a couple of ways to perform a take operation that we'll go through here, and their performance.\nFor example, the toPandas() is a take operation which you've already seen in many places.\nOption 1 - collect()\npets.collect()\n\n[Row(id=u'1', breed_id=u'1', nickname=u'King', birthday=u'2014-11-22 12:30:31', age=u'5', color=u'brown'),\n Row(id=u'2', breed_id=u'3', nickname=u'Argus', birthday=u'2016-11-22 10:05:10', age=u'10', color=None),\n Row(id=u'3', breed_id=u'1', nickname=u'Chewie', birthday=u'2016-11-22 10:05:10', age=u'15', color=None)]\nWhat Happened?\nWhen you call collect on a dataframe, it will trigger a take operation, bring all the data to the driver node and then return all rows as a lists of Row objects.\nNote\nThis should not be advised unless you have to look at all the rows of your dataset, you should usually sample a subset of the data. This call will execution all of the transformations that you have specified on all the data.\nOption 2 - head()/take()/first()\npets.head(n=1)\n\n[Row(id=u'1', breed_id=u'1', nickname=u'King', birthday=u'2014-11-22 12:30:31', age=u'5', color=u'brown')]\nWhat Happened?\nWhen you call head(n) on a dataframe, it will trigger a take operation and return the first n rows of the result dataset. The different operations will return different number of rows.\nNote\n\nIf the data is unsorted, spark will perform the all the transformations on a selected amount of partitions until the number of rows are satified. This is much optimal based on how much and large your dataset is.\nIf the data is sorted, spark will perform the same as a collect and perform all of the transformations on all of the data.\n\nBy sorted we mean, if any sort of \"sorting of the data\" is done during the transformations, such as sort(), orderBy(), etc.\nOption 3 - toPandas()\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\nWhen you call a toPandas() on a dataframe, it will trigger a take operation and return all of the rows.\nThis is as performant as the collect() function, but the most readible in my opinion.\nOption 4 - show()\npets.show()\n\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+\n| id|breed_id|nickname|           birthday|age|color|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+\n|  1|       1|    King|2014-11-22 12:30:31|  5|brown|\n|  2|       3|   Argus|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 10| null|\n|  3|       1|  Chewie|2016-11-22 10:05:10| 15| null|\n+---+--------+--------+-------------------+---+-----+\nWhat Happened?\nWhen you call a show() on a dataframe, it will trigger a take operation return up to 20 rows.\nThis is as performant as the head() function and more readible. (I still perfer toPandas() üòÄ).\nSummary\n\nWe learnt about various functions that allow you to look at your data.\nSome functions are less performant than others based on if the resultant data is sorted or not.\nTry to refrain from looking at all the data, unless you are required to.\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.2 - Selecting a Subset of Columns.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.2 - Selecting a Subset of Columns.html","title":"Section 2.2 - Selecting a Subset of Columns","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.1 - Looking at Your Data\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a Subset of Columns\nWhen you're working with raw data, you are usually only interested in a subset of columns. This means you should get into the habit of only selecting the columns you need before any spark transformations.\nWhy?\nIf you do not, and you are working with a wide dataset this will cause your spark application to do more work than it should do. This is because all the extra columns will  be shuffled between the worker during the execution of the transformations. \nThis will really kill you, if you have string columns that have really large amounts of text within them.\nNote\nSpark is sometimes smart enough to know which columns aren't being used and perform a Project Pushdown to drop the unneeded columns. But it's better practice to do the selection first. \nOption 1 - select()\n(\n    pets\n    .select(\"id\", \"nickname\", \"color\")\n    .toPandas()\n)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      nickname\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      King\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      Argus\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      Chewie\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\nSimilar to a sql select statement, it will only keep the columns specified in the arguments in the resulting df. a list object can be passed as the argument as well.\nIf you have a wide dataset and only want to work with a small number of columns, a select would be less lines of code.\nNote\nIf the argument * is provided, all the columns will be selected.\nOption 2 - drop()\n(\n    pets\n    .drop(\"breed_id\", \"birthday\", \"age\")\n    .toPandas()\n)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      nickname\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      King\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      Argus\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      Chewie\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\nThis is the opposite of a select statement it will drop an of the columns specified.\nIf you have a wide dataset and will need a majority of the columns, a drop would be less lines of code.\nSummary\n\nWork with only the subset of columns required for your spark application, there is no need do extra work.\nDepending on the number of columns you are going to work with, a select over a drop would be better and vice-versa.\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.3 - Creating New Columns and Transforming Data.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.3 - Creating New Columns and Transforming Data.html","title":"Section 2.3 - Creating New Columns and Transforming Data","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.3 - Creating New Columns\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCreating New Columns and Transforming Data\nWhen we are data wrangling, transforming data, we will using assign the result to a new column.

But this isn't the case when we want set a column to a constant value.\nIf you get an AssertionError: col should be Column that is usually the case, we'll look into how to fix this.\nCase 1: Creating a Column with a constant value (withColumn()) (correct)\npets.withColumn('todays_date', F.lit(date.today())).toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n      todays_date\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n      2019-02-14\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n      2019-02-14\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n      2019-02-14\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\nWith F.lit() you can create a column expression that you can now assign to a new column in your dataframe.\nMore Examples\n(\n    pets\n    .withColumn('age_greater_than_5', F.col(\"age\") > 5)\n    .withColumn('height', F.lit(150))\n    .where(F.col('breed_id') == 1)\n    .where(F.col('breed_id') == F.lit(1))\n    .toPandas()\n)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n      age_greater_than_5\n      height\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n      False\n      150\n    \n    \n      1\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n      True\n      150\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\n(We will look into equilities statements later.)\nThe above contains constant values (column height) and column expressions (columns using F.col()) so a F.lit() is not required.\nSummary\n\nYou need to use F.lit() to assign constant values to columns.\nEquality expressions with F.col() is also another way to have a column expressions.\nWhen in doubt, always use column expressions F.lit().\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.5 - Casting Columns to Different Type.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.5 - Casting Columns to Different Type.html","title":"Section 2.5 - Casting Columns to Different Type","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.5 - Casting Columns to Different Type\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nCasting Columns in Different Types\nSometimes your data can be read in as all unicode/string in which you will need to cast them to the correct type.

This is again very similar to sql syntax.\nSummary\n\nWe learnt of two filter functions in Spark where() and isin().\nUsing isin you can see if a column can contain multiple values.\nThese functions are named similarly to a sql language.\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.7 - Equality Statements in Spark and Comparison with Nulls.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.7 - Equality Statements in Spark and Comparison with Nulls.html","title":"Section 2.7 - Equality Statements in Spark and Comparison with Nulls","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.7 - Equality Statements in Spark and Comparison with Nulls\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n    \n      3\n      3\n      2\n      Maple\n      2018-11-22 10:05:10\n      17\n      white\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering Data\nWhen you want ot filter data with more than just one expression, there are a couple of gotchas that you will need to be careful of.\nCase 1: Multiple Conditions\n(\n    pets\n    .where(\n        (F.col('breed_id') == 1) &\n        (F.col('color') == 'brown') &\n        F.col('color').isin('brown')\n    )\n    .toPandas()\n)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?\nWhen there exists more than 1 condition you will to wrap each condition in () brackets and as well provide bitwise operations instead of logical operations in Python.\nWhy?\nThis is because in the spark internals they had to overwrite the logical operations and was only left with the bitwise operations.

This function will try to fill in the specified columns by looking at the given arguments in order from left to right, until one of the arguments is not null and use that. If all else fails, you can provide a \"default\" value as your last arugment (remembering that it should be a columnar expression). \nIn our example, it will attempt to fill in the bogus column with values from the color column first, if that is null then try the nickname column next, and if both are null it will use the deafult value Default.\nSummary\n\nWe looked at a generic way of filling in a columns with a single default value.\nWe looked at providing a mapping of {column:value} to fill in each column seperately.\nLastly we looked at how to fill in a column using other columns and default values in an order of precedency.\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.10 - Spark Functions aren't Enough, I Need my Own!.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.10 - Spark Functions aren't Enough, I Need my Own!.html","title":"Section 2.10 - Spark Functions aren't Enough, I Need my Own!","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.10 - Spark Functions aren't Enough, I Need my Own!\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n    \n      3\n      3\n      2\n      Maple\n      2018-11-22 10:05:10\n      17\n      white\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nSpark Functions aren't Enough, I Need my Own!\nWhat happens when you can't find functions that can perform what you want?

This means if you want to use other values, you will need to cast it to a column object using F.lit() from the previous sections.\nRegister the python function as a spark function, and specify the spark return type.

This will require extra python memory for your spark application (will explain in Chapter 6) and more passing of data between the JVM and Python.\nIf your function can be performed with the spark functions, you should alway use the spark functions. udfs perform very poorly compared to the spark functions. This is a greate response that encapsulates the reason as to why:\n\nThe main reasons are already enumerated above and can be reduced to a simple fact that Spark DataFrame is natively a JVM structure and standard access methods are implemented by simple calls to Java API. UDF from the other hand are implemented in Python and require moving data back and forth.\nWhile PySpark in general requires data movements between JVM and Python, in case of low level RDD API it typically doesn't require expensive serde activity. Spark SQL adds additional cost of serialization and serialization as well cost of moving data from and to unsafe representation on JVM. The later one is specific to all UDFs (Python, Scala and Java) but the former one is specific to non-native languages.\nUnlike UDFs, Spark SQL functions operate directly on JVM and typically are well integrated with both Catalyst and Tungsten. It means these can be optimized in the execution plan and most of the time can benefit from codgen and other Tungsten optimizations. Moreover these can operate on data in its \"native\" representation.\nSo in a sense the problem here is that Python UDF has to bring data to the code while SQL expressions go the other way around.\n\nsource: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38296609/spark-functions-vs-udf-performance\nOption 3: Pandas Vectorized UDFs\n# TODO: https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html\n\nSummary\n\nWe learnt how to use a python function within spark, called udfs.\nWe learnt how to pass non-column objects into the function by using knowledge gained from previous chapters.\nWe learnt about the bad parts of udfs and their performance issues.\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.11  - Unionizing Multiple Dataframes.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.11  - Unionizing Multiple Dataframes.html","title":"Section 2.11  - Unionizing Multiple Dataframes","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types as T\n\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.11  - Unionizing Multiple Dataframes\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\nimport os\n\ndata_path = \"/data/pets.csv\"\nbase_path = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())\npath = base_path + data_path\n\npets = spark.read.csv(path, header=True)\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n      birthday\n      age\n      color\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      King\n      2014-11-22 12:30:31\n      5\n      brown\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      3\n      Argus\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      10\n      None\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      1\n      Chewie\n      2016-11-22 10:05:10\n      15\n      None\n    \n    \n      3\n      3\n      2\n      Maple\n      2018-11-22 10:05:10\n      17\n      white\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nUnionizing Multiple Dataframes\nThere are a couple of situations where you would want to perform an union transformation.\nCase 1: Collecting Data from Various Sources\nWhen you're collecting data from multiple sources, some point in your spark application you will need to reconcile all the different sources into the same format and work with a single source of truth. This will require you to union the different datasets together.\nCase 2: Perfoming Different Transformations on your Dataset\nSometimes you would like to perform seperate transformations on different parts of your data based on your task.

How? For each of the new df that you would like to union with the original df you will select the column from the original df during the union. This will:\n\nGuarantees the ordering of the columns, as a select will select the columns in order of which they are listed in.\nGuarantees that only the columns of the original df is selected, from the previous sections, we know that select will only the specified columns.\n\nSummary\n\nAlways always be careful when you are unioning df together.\nWhen you union dfs together you should ensure:\nThe number of columns are the same.\nThe columns are the exact same.\nThe columns are in the same order.\n\n\n\n"},"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.12 - Performing Joins <clean one>.html":{"url":"Chapter 2 - Exploring the Spark APIs/Section 2.12 - Performing Joins <clean one>.html","title":"Section 2.12 - Performing Joins ","keywords":"","body":"Library Imports\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\nTemplate\nspark = (\n    SparkSession.builder\n    .master(\"local\")\n    .appName(\"Section 2.12 - Performing Joins (clean one)\")\n    .config(\"spark.some.config.option\", \"some-value\")\n    .getOrCreate()\n)\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n\npets = spark.createDataFrame(\n    [\n        (1, 1, 'Bear'),\n        (2, 1, 'Chewie'),\n        (3, 2, 'Roger'),\n    ], ['id', 'breed_id', 'nickname']\n)\n\npets.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      breed_id\n      nickname\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      1\n      Bear\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      1\n      Chewie\n    \n    \n      2\n      3\n      2\n      Roger\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nbreeds = spark.createDataFrame(\n    [\n        (1, 'Pitbull', 10), \n        (2, 'Corgie', 20), \n    ], ['id', 'name', 'average_height']\n)\n\nbreeds.toPandas()\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      id\n      name\n      average_height\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      Pitbull\n      10\n    \n    \n      1\n      2\n      Corgie\n      20\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming Joins\nThere are typically two types of joins in sql:\n\nInner Join is where 2 tables are joined on the basis of common columns mentioned in the ON clause.\n ie. left.join(right, left[lkey] == right[rkey])\n\n\n\nNatural Join is where 2 tables are joined on the basis of all common columns.      \n ie. left.join(right, 'key')\n\n\nsource: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8696402\nQuestion:\n    Which is better?

Your code isn't executing in a sequential manor anymore, it's being executing in parallel. To write performant parallel code, you will need to think about how you can perform as different/same tasks at the same while minimizing the blocking of other tasks. Hopefully by understanding how spark and distributed systems work you can get into the right mindset and write clean parallel spark code.\nUnderstanding Distributed Systems/Computing\nSequential Applications\nIn a generic application the code path is run in a sequential order. As in the code will execute from the top of the file to the bottom of the file, line by line.\nMultiprocess/threaded Applications\nIn a multi-processed/threaded application the code path will diverge. The application will assign a portions of the code to threads/processes which will handle these tasks in an asynchronous manner. Once these tasks are completed the threads/processes will signal the main application and the code path will conform again.\nThese threads/processes are allocated a certain amount of memory and processing power on a single machine where the main application is running.\nThink about how your computer can handle multiple applications at once. This is multiple processes running on a single machine.\nDistributed Computing (Clusters and Nodes)\nSpark is a distributed computing library that can be used in either Python, Scala, Java or R. When we say \"distributed computing\" we mean that our application runs on multiple machines/computers called Nodes which are all part of a single Cluster.\nThis is very similar to how a multi-processed application would work, just with more processing juice. Each Node is essentially a computer running multiple process running at once.\n\nMaster/Slave Architecture\nFrom the image in the last section we can see there are 2 types of Nodes, a single Driver/Master Node and multiple Worker Nodes.\nEach machine is assigned a portion of the overall work in the application. Through communication and message passing the machines attempt to compute each portion of the work in parallel. When the work is dependent on another portion of work, then it will have to wait until that work is computed and passed to the worker. When every portion of the work is done, it is all sent back to the Master Node. The coordination of the communication and message passing is done  by the Master Node talking to the Worker Nodes.\nYou can think of it as a team lead with multiple engineers, UX, designers, etc. The lead assigns tasks to everyone. The designers and UX collaborate to create an effective interface that is user friendly, once they are done they report back to the lead. The lead will pass this information to engineers and they can start coding the interface, etc.\nLazy Execution\nWhen you're writing a spark application, no work is actually being done until you perform a collect action. As seen in some examples in the previous chapters, a collect action is when you want to see the results of your spark transformations in the form of a toPandas(), show(), etc. This triggers the Driver to start the distribution of work, etc.\nFor now this is all you need to know, we will look into why Spark works this way and why it's a desired design decision.\nMapReduce\nWhen the Driver Node actually starts to do some work, it communications and distributes work using a technique called \"MapReduce\". There are two essential behaviors of a MapReduce application, map and reduce.\n\nMap\nWhen the Driver Node is distributing the work it maps the 1) data and 2) transformations to each Worker Node. This allows the Worker Nodes to perform the work (transformations) on the associated data in parallel.\nEx.\n# initialize your variables\nx = 5\ny = 10\n\n# do some transformations to your variables\nx = x * 2\ny = y + 2\n\nHere we can see that the arithmetic operations performed on x and y can be done independently, so we can do those 2 operations in parallel on two different Worker Nodes. So Spark will map x and the operation x * 2 to a Worker Node and y and y + 2 to another Worker Node.\nThink about this but on a larger scale, we have 1 billion rows of numbers that we want to increment by 1. We will map portions of the data to each Worker Node and the operation + 1 to each Worker Node.\nReduce\nWhen work can't be done in parallel and is dependent on some previous work, the post transformed data is sent back to the Driver Node from all the Worker Nodes. There the new data may be redistributed to the Worker Nodes to resume execution or execution is done on the Driver Node depending on the type of work.\nEx.\n# initialize your variables\nx = 5\ny = 10\n\n# do some transformations to your variables\nx = x * 2\ny = y + 2\n\n# do some more transformations\nz = x + y\n\nSimilar to the example above, but here we see that the last transformation z = x + y depends on the previous transformations. So we will need to collect all the work done on the Worker Nodes to the Driver Node and perform the final transformation.\nKey Terms\nDriver Node\nLearnt above.\nWorker\nLearnt above.\nExecutor\nA process launched from an application on a Worker Node, that runs tasks and keeps data in memory or disk storage across them.

performed on both sides, but not always.\nYou should alway check to see if your Spark DAG is performant during a join and if any filters can be pushed before the joins.\n\n"},"Chapter 7 - High

duplicate the data so we have a row for each salt value.\nWhen performing the join, we perform a hashpartitioning on [customer_id, salt].\n\nResults:\n\nWhen we produce a row per salt value, we have essentially duplicated (num_partitions - 1) * N rows.\nThis created more data, but allowed us to spread the data across more partitions as you can see from hashpartitioning(customer_id, salt).\n\nSummary\nAll to say:\n\nBy salting our keys, the skewed dataset gets divided into smaller partitions. Thus removing the skew.\nAgain we will sacrifice more resources in order to get a performance gain or a successful run.\nWe produced more data by creating (num_partitions - 1) * N more data for the right side.\n\n"},"Chapter 7 - High Performance Code/Section 1.4 - Joins on Skewed Data <High Frequency Keys II> <WIP>.html":{"url":"Chapter 7 - High Performance Code/Section 1.4 - Joins on Skewed Data <High Frequency Keys II> <WIP>.html","title":"Section 1.4 - Joins on Skewed Data  ","keywords":"","body":"A skewed dataset is defined by a dataset that has a class imbalance, this leads to poor or failing spark jobs that often get a OOM (out of memory) error.\nWhen performing a join onto a skewed dataset it's usually the case where there is an imbalance on the key(s) on which the join is performed on.
